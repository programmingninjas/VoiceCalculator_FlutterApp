# VoiceCalculator_FlutterApp
This is my first Android app made with flutter as a frontend and python as a backend. Using Flask for API communication between frontend and backend. It's almost like the Web App version of voice calculator. 
I'm attaching files that i altered in frontend folder in order to run this application with main dart file.

For instructions read README file of VoiceCalcultor(WebApp)
